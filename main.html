	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

    <p>
        I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and creating useful applications using technology. 
        Programming allows me to turn ideas into reality and continuously learn new skills. 
        Being a developer gives me the opportunity to work on real-world problems and build solutions that can help people and businesses.
